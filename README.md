Welcome to LinkScout gem!

LinkScout helps users to find broken links by analysing response code or body.

It can take single or multiple URLs as input making it easy to handle link checking in larger batches.
It can also follow links through redirect chains making sure links eventually work for your users.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'link_scout'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install link_scout

## Usage
  ```ruby
  options = {
    success: 200,
    follow: true,
    limit: 1,
    target: 'http://target.com',

    pattern: /abc/i,
